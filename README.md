*Full tech details in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)*

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm/pnpm
- Git

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with:
```
# AI Provider Configuration
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter  # Options: openrouter (default), openai, gemini

# API Keys (only need the key for your chosen provider)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

# Firebase config ✅ 
# Maps API key (to be added)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/tiffting/veganbnb.git
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## AI Configuration

VeganBnB supports multiple AI providers for flexibility and reliability:

- **OpenRouter** (default) - Stable, reliable, uses WizardLM-2-8x22b model
- **OpenAI** - Fast and cost-effective with GPT-4o-mini
- **Google Gemini** - Uses gemini-1.5-flash for good performance

To switch providers, simply update `AI_PROVIDER` in `.env.local`:
```bash
AI_PROVIDER=openai     # Use OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
AI_PROVIDER=gemini     # Use Google Gemini
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter # Use OpenRouter (default)
```

Test your configuration:
```bash
node tests/test-ai-config.js
```

## Current Status
