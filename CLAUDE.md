    - localStorage persistence for demo
    - Auto-apply preferences to map filtering (no chat integration needed)
    - "Remember my settings" UX

**Technical Specification for Preferences**:

```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
    budgetRange: "€" | "€€" | "€€€" | "any";
    minSafetyScore: number; // 70, 80, 90+
    dietaryRestrictions: string[]; // ["gluten-free", "nut-free"]
    maxDistance: number; // km radius for map
    openNow: boolean; // filter for currently open venues
    
    // NEW: Enhanced travel preferences
    eatingPreferences: {
        includeBreakfast: boolean;
        includeSnacks: boolean;  
        style: "foodie" | "casual" | "efficient";
        preferredMealTimes?: {
            breakfast?: string;  // "8:00"
            lunch?: string;     // "12:30" 
            dinner?: string;    // "19:00"
        };
    };
    mobilityPreferences: {
        transportModes: ("walking" | "public_transit" | "taxi")[];
        wheelchairAccessible: boolean;
        maxWalkingDistance: number; // minutes
        preferredPace: "leisurely" | "moderate" | "efficient";
    };
    tripPreferences: {
        planningStyle: "structured" | "flexible";
        groupSize?: number;
        travelDates?: { start: string; end: string; };
    };
}
```

**Shared Components**:

- Both interfaces consume the same mock data and safety analyzer

### Winning Positioning

**Problem**: Vegan travelers juggle HappyCow + Vegvisits + Google + Meetup + Eventbrite + Facebook for EVERY trip. No platform offers complete travel intelligence across restaurants, accommodations, tours, and local experiences.

**Solution**: First AI-powered complete vegan travel intelligence platform using multi-modal AI (NLP review analysis, conversational assistant, computer vision) to provide explainable safety scores across all travel categories and eliminate the fragmented research problem.

**Key differentiators**:

- Complete travel coverage (not just restaurants)
- Explainable AI with review citations
- Multi-modal technology
- **Actionable trip planning** with eSIM-friendly booking methods
- **Complete operational logistics** (hours, pricing, schedules, transit)

---

### Target Persona & Market Strategy

**PRIMARY PERSONA: Established vegans (1-5 years) who travel 2+ times/year**

**Why this is our largest TAM:**

**Market size:**

- Global vegans: 79M+
- Travel 2+ times/year: ~40% = **31M addressable users**
- Growing 20-25% annually in key markets

**Pain severity:**

- Confident enough to travel but still face cobbling friction (HappyCow + Vegvisits + Google + Reddit)
- Highest willingness to pay ($5-15/month for complete solution)
- Active social media sharers (organic growth multiplier)

**Competition gap:**

- HappyCow: restaurants only
- Vegvisits: accommodations only
- **No complete solution exists = blue ocean opportunity**

**MVP validation target:**

- Europe focus: 1M potential users (Germany 500K)
- Proof of concept → global expansion pitch

**Secondary personas** (TAM expansion opportunities):

- Non-vegans exploring plant-based (3x market size potential)
- Business travelers (premium pricing tier)
- New vegans (onboarding funnel from advocacy orgs)

**Revenue potential:**

- 31M × $8/month avg × 5% conversion rate = **$148M TAM**
- Realistic Year 1 goal: 10K users × $8/month = $960K ARR

---

### MVP Scope (7-hr build window - FOCUSED)

**TIER 1 - MUST DEMO:**

- **Multi-category database**: 20 restaurants + 10 accommodations + 5 tours + 5 events (Berlin) with 3-5 review excerpts each
- **Category-Adaptive AI Review Analyzer** (HERO FEATURE): AI extracts safety signals specific to each category, generates explainable scores with citations
- **AI Travel Assistant Chatbot** (SHOWSTOPPER): Conversational interface for complete trip planning across all categories
- User authentication (Firebase)
- Map view with category filtering

**CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED**: Current chatbot provides recommendations but lacks **actionable logistics** for true itinerary planning

**TIER 2 - IF TIME (unlikely with 7-hr window):**

- **Computer Vision Menu Translator**: Upload photo → translated menu + vegan options highlighted
- Mobile PWA optimization
- Itinerary builder

**CUT:**

- Native mobile app
- Social features
- Booking integration

---

### Post-Hackathon Priority: Actionable Travel Intelligence

**Current State**: Chatbot provides safety-focused recommendations but lacks logistics for actual trip execution.

**Example Gap**:

- ✅ Current: "I recommend The Green Market Berlin (91/100 safety score) for excellent food quality"
- ❌ Missing: "The Green Market Berlin happens regularly at Boxhagener Platz, 10am-6pm with diverse vegan vendors"

**Essential Logistics Data Needed**:

**For Restaurants**:

- Operating hours (daily schedules + seasonal changes)
- Reservation requirements/policies
- Price ranges and payment methods
- Location details (exact address + nearest transit)

**For Accommodations**:

- Availability calendars and booking links
- Check-in/check-out procedures
- Amenity access hours (kitchen, breakfast times)
- Cancellation policies

**For Tours**:

- Scheduled dates and duration
- Meeting points and logistics
- Booking requirements and group sizes
- Weather-dependent scheduling

**For Events**:

- Recurring schedules (weekly/monthly patterns)
- Ticket availability and pricing
- Venue capacity and accessibility
- Duration and programming details

**Implementation Strategy**:

**Phase 1 - Data Enhancement** (Post-hackathon priority):

- Expand `lib/types.ts` with logistics fields
- Update mock data with realistic schedules
- Enhance database schema for operational details

**Phase 2 - Smart Scheduling**:

- AI understands time constraints ("3-day trip")
- Suggests realistic daily itineraries with travel time
- Flags scheduling conflicts and availability issues

**Phase 3 - Live Integration**:

- Real-time availability APIs (Google Places, booking platforms)
- Calendar integration for personal trip planning
- Smart notifications for schedule changes

**Business Impact**: This transforms VeganBnB from "discovery tool" to "complete travel assistant" - justifying premium pricing and increasing user stickiness.

### Post-Hackathon Vision: Beyond Vegan-Only Content

**Key Market Insight**: Vegans are multidimensional travelers interested in art, history, culture, architecture, fitness, wellness, and all aspects of travel - not just vegan-specific venues.

**Expansion Opportunity**:

- **Current MVP**: Vegan-focused restaurants, accommodations, tours, events (essential foundation)
- **Future Vision**: Comprehensive travel assistant that happens to excel at vegan needs
    - Museums & galleries with vegan cafes
    - Historical sites with nearby plant-based dining
    - Architecture tours that accommodate dietary needs
    - Wellness retreats and fitness activities
    - Cultural experiences with inclusive food options
    - Local neighborhoods with strong vegan infrastructure

**Competitive Advantage**:

- Start with underserved vegan niche (defensive moat)
- Expand to general travel while maintaining vegan expertise
- Unlike generic travel apps, we understand dietary intersection with all travel categories

**Data Strategy for Expansion** (Future Investigation):

- Partner with mainstream travel APIs (TripAdvisor, Google Places)
- Overlay vegan-accessibility scores on general attractions
- Community-sourced accessibility ratings for non-food venues
- AI analysis: "This museum has a great vegan cafe" or "Walking distance to 3 vegan restaurants"

**Demo Script Addition**:
"While we're starting with vegan-specific venues, our vision extends beyond that. Vegans are interested in art, culture, history - everything travelers love. We see VeganBnB expanding to cover all travel categories while maintaining our expertise in dietary accessibility. Think: 'This museum has excellent vegan dining nearby' or 'This architectural walking tour accommodates all dietary needs.'"

**Market Sizing Impact**:

- **Phase 1**: 79M vegans globally (current TAM)
- **Phase 2**: 850M+ conscious travelers who value inclusive experiences
- **Unique positioning**: The travel app that truly understands dietary accessibility across ALL experiences

### Data Architecture Strategy: Store vs Fetch

**The Challenge**: Logistics data has different update frequencies and reliability needs.

**Hybrid Approach** (Recommended):

**STORE LOCALLY** (Performance + Reliability):

- **Basic hours** (restaurants, shops) - Changes infrequently, critical for trip planning
- **Recurring events** (weekly markets, monthly meetups) - Predictable patterns
- **Price ranges** - Rough estimates sufficient, changes slowly
- **Contact/booking info** - Relatively stable

**FETCH REAL-TIME** (Accuracy Critical):

- **Current availability** (hotel rooms, tour spots) - High volatility
- **Special closures** (holidays, maintenance) - Unpredictable changes
- **Live pricing** (dynamic pricing models) - Constant fluctuation
- **Event cancellations** - Critical accuracy for user experience

**Update Strategy by Category**:

**Restaurants**:

- Store: Basic hours, contact info, price range
- Fetch: Holiday closures, special events, current wait times (if available)
- Update frequency: Monthly batch updates + real-time closure checks

**Accommodations**:

- Store: Check-in policies, amenity hours, contact info
- Fetch: Room availability, current pricing, booking links
- Update frequency: Real-time for availability, weekly for policies

**Tours**:

- Store: General schedules, meeting points, booking requirements
- Fetch: Available dates, current pricing, capacity status
- Update frequency: Real-time for bookings, monthly for logistics

**Events**:

- Store: Recurring patterns, venue info, typical pricing
- Fetch: Specific dates, ticket availability, last-minute changes
- Update frequency: Real-time for tickets, weekly for schedules

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
interface Listing {
    // Stored locally (cached)
    basicInfo: {
        hours: OperatingHours;
        contact: ContactInfo;
        priceRange: string;
    };

    // Fetched real-time
    liveData: {
        availability?: AvailabilityStatus;
        currentPricing?: PricingInfo;
        specialNotices?: string[];
    };

    lastUpdated: {
        basicInfo: Date;
        liveData: Date;
    };
}
```

**Business Benefits**:

- **Fast UX**: Instant basic info from local storage
- **Accurate planning**: Real-time availability prevents disappointment
- **Cost efficiency**: Minimize expensive API calls for stable data
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when external APIs fail

### Demo Script (5 minutes)

**0:00-0:30 | The Problem + Market**
"31 million established vegans travel 2+ times per year, and we ALL do the same exhausting research dance: HappyCow for restaurants, Vegvisits for hotels, Google for tours, Meetup/Eventbrite/Facebook for events. Every single trip = 5+ sources, hours of cobbling together fragmented information. We're confident enough to travel, but the research friction is real. No one gives us complete travel intelligence. Until now."

**0:30-2:00 | Multi-Category AI Analysis (HERO)**

- Show home page with 4 categories
- Click accommodation → safety score displayed
- **Click "Why this score?"** → modal shows:
    - AI reasoning specific to accommodations
    - Review citations ("2 reviews mention 'dedicated vegan kitchen'...")
    - Signal breakdown (shared kitchen safety: 85, bedding: 100, breakfast: 90)
- Quick click through restaurant (different signals: cross-contamination, staff knowledge)
- "Our LLM adapts to each category. Same explainable intelligence across all travel decisions."

**2:00-4:00 | Complete Trip Planning (SHOWSTOPPER)**

- Switch to chat interface
- **Live demo**: "Plan my 3-day vegan trip to Berlin"
- AI responds with ACTIONABLE recommendations:
    - A&O Berlin Mitte (78/100) - "Check-in 3pm, vegan breakfast available upon request"
    - Kopps restaurant (98/100) - "Open Wed-Sat from 5:30pm, reservations required"
    - Berlin Vegan Food Tour (94/100) - "Saturdays 2-6pm, meet at Hackescher Markt"
    - The Green Market Berlin (91/100) - "Regular vegan market with diverse vendors"
